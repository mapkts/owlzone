[Today’s](https://google.com/doodles/celebrating-the-mariniere) animated Doodle celebrates the iconic French blue-and-white-striped shirt, the marinière (French for “sailor shirt”). On this day in 1858, the French Navy decreed this versatile undergarment part of the official uniform of its sailors, marking the genesis of the top’s storied journey into closets around the world.

今天的动画涂鸦致敬标志性的法国条纹衬衫marinière（法语意为“海军衫”）。1858年的这一天，法国海军将这一多用途内衣定为其海军正式制服的一种，标志着这一上衣开始了其进入世界橱窗的传奇之旅。

Knit tightly from wool in order to guard seafarers against the harsh elements of their maritime environment, the marinière’s initial function is well-known. However, the significance of the sweater’s striped design is still up for debate. Some stories say the horizontal stripes were designed to make it easier to spot sailors who fell overboard, while other accounts claim that each stripe was meant to represent one of Napoleon’s naval victories over the British. Regardless of its history, there is no denying that the marinière has since transformed into an unmistakable statement of style.

marinière最初的功能众所周知，它由羊毛紧密编织而成，以保护海员免受海上恶劣环境的影响。然而，这件毛衣条纹设计的意义仍有待商榷。一些故事说，水平条纹的设计是为了更容易发现落水的水手，而另一些说法则声称每一道条纹都代表了拿破仑战胜英国海军的一次胜利。无论其历史如何，都不能否认自此以后marinière转变为一种明确的风格表达。

In the late 19th century, the marinière began its migration from navy decks to city streets with the help of French writer Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette. Frequently spotted at masked balls in Paris wearing the now-iconic striped shirt, Colette boldly broke conventional gender stereotypes and helped to pave the way for modern womenswear.

十九世纪末，在法国作家Sidonie-Gabirielle Colette的推动下，marinière开始了从海军甲板到城市街道的迁移。Colette经常穿着现在标志性的条纹衬衫出现在在法国的假面舞会上，她大胆地打破了对性别的传统刻板印象，为现代女装铺就道路。

By the 1920s, bohemians, intellectuals, and fashionistas of the French Riviera had adopted the marinière, further cementing the jersey’s evolution from a staple of nautical life to a symbol of artistic chic.

到20世纪20年代，法国Riviera地区的波西米亚人、知识分子和潮流人士开始拥抱marinière, 进一步推动了该针织衫从海上生活必需品到艺术时尚标志的演变。

From artists to movie stars, the marinière has earned countless iconic endorsements over the decades, respected and seen today as a timeless classic the world over.

从艺术家到电影明星，marinière在过去的几十年中赢得了无数标志性的背书，受到推崇并被视为当今世界永恒的经典。
